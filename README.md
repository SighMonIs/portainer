# Portainer Templates V0.1
I have no idea what I'm doing with GitHub, should have forked, didn't do that, downloaded some stuff and trying to get this to work for just the apps I like. Kinda using this as a backup of sorts for my apps.

### Prerequisites

1. A server/NAS with docker installed.
2. A Portainer-CE setup.

### Installing

1. Login to your Portainer setup go to settings
2. Go to:  Application settings > App Templates
3. Add the url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SighMonIs/portainer/main/template.json` then go to app templates and hit refresh at the top.
